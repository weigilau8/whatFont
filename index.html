                    <p>And so I count to three</p>
                    <p>And get on one knee</p>
                    <p>And I ask you</p>
                    <p>Darlin', honestly</p>

                    <h6>Verse 2</h6>
                    <p>A gentle touch of the hand, fingers runnin' through hair</p>
                    <p>Lips pressed to her lips, oh, I was caught unaware</p>
                    <p>Arms holdin' me tight, tears in both of our eyes</p>
                    <p>What a beautiful way to spend the rest of our lives</p>
                    <p>Sun will reappear, burnin' auburn and red</p>
                    <p>My chest was the pillow, green grass lawn was the bed</p>
                    <p>Last night was the night, one last moment of truth</p>
                    <p>And what a wonderful way to fall in deeper in you</p>
